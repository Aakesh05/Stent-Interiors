# Stent Interiors (Use MVC framework)
 
My good friend Cameron came to me interest of me making him a website for his Design business “Stent Interiors”. He wanted to be able to have a Home page, About Page and a Book a meeting page.

He would like guests to be able to book a time to meet with the interior designer specialist to directly go to his email.

•	Book a meeting Page – Book a meeting to directly go to him emails so he can arrange a meeting at the wanted time.
•	Home Page - Body (Text, Photos) – To showcase his designs and explanations on his projects
•	Any theme

The Website will be called “Stent Interiors” It will showcase a series of Cameron’s Projects
